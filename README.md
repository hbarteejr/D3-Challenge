# D3-Challenge

In this project, while using the D3 techniques, I was able to create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. The graphics were coded in the `app.js` file.  Data was pulled from the `data.csv` file by using the `d3.csv` function. After this was done, then a scatter plot was created with a comparison of healthcare vs. poverty.
